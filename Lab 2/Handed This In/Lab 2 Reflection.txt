Lab 2 gave me trouble because of my own stupidity, and only after taking a second look at everything that was
involved in the error I finally noticed my bug, a simple mistake made by using autofill blindly.

I started the Lab by following the requirements, Set up 1 Relative Layout, and then added 3 Linear Layouts inside 
it. After giving each and ID, I used the "android:layout_below" to make each layout below the previous.
Then back to adding widgets and the like as the lab required.

I settled on the idea of ordering a burger from McDonalds, selecting a burger from a spinner that used a string array
as the list, adding toppings with the checkboxes that had an if statement checking if any were checked, and finally
adding a seekBar linked to a TextView that updated the text in increments of 5 for 3 max.

The app displays the Burger selected, the toppings added (if any were), and leaves a message about how much you
are tipping if the amount is above 0%

The hardest part other then debugging was setting up an Alert since it was required of us, but there was no guidance
on how to do so. I am very pleased with the help I was able to get from YouTube. Additionally I entered a Toast that
Thanked the customer after the order was complete.

Learned a lot about the back end of setOnClickListeners,  findViewById, and ArrayAdapters.
Also had a long fight with Inner Class variables and how they could not interact with variables from outside the class
turned out I just had to make them global, then everything went smoooth.

I feel like I could have used the Logcat sooner to debug faster, and trying to jump into coding with limited knowledge of nested
listeners or if that was even possible... such as the press of a button listener then checking the that the other listeners were 
acted on.

In the end I made a beautiful and simple app that I'm genuinly proud of.
If I had more time and was doing this beyong the expectations of the lab I would tighten up the functions and add code that prevented
repeats, but it's not a requirement, and I have wasted a ton of time getting it to this stage, and even going beyong the expectations of
the lab with the seekBar being linked to a text view and used in such a way.
